# Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains machine learning notebooks for competitions hosted on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) platform. It serves as a collection of projects showcasing various machine learning approaches, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and CatBoostClassifiers.

## Current Projects

### **S4E11 Mental Health Competition**
This project focuses on the **Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 11** competition, which explores mental health data. The goal of this competition is to analyze and classify data related to mental health, drawing insights and developing effective predictive models.

#### Models
1. **Model 1 (CatBoostClassifier)**:  
   - Implements an Artificial Neural Network for classification tasks.  
   - Designed to capture patterns in the provided dataset using deep learning techniques.

#### Dataset Citation
The dataset used for this project is from the following Kaggle competition:  
**Walter Reade and Elizabeth Park. Exploring Mental Health Data.**
